Piano Scribe
=================
This app converts raw audio to MIDI using [Onsets and Frames](https://g.co/magenta/onsets-frames), a neural network trained for polyphonic 
piano transcription. 

Record yourself playing piano or choose an audio file with solo piano from your device to transcribe!

Don't have a piano? Try singing to it to see what your voice sounds like played by a piano! Your voice isn't a piano though, so it might not sound like you at all ðŸ˜….
          
All of the processing happens locally in the browser using [Magenta.js](https://g.co/magenta) and [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/).
